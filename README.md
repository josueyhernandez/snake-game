About:
This project is a popular game called Nokia Snake where the user can control the movement of the snake in a container in which the user has to eat an item called an apple which increases the snake's size and speed. The object of the game is to get as many apples without crashing to any of the borders and without letting the snake hit itself. At the end of the game the user will see how many points they were able to get. Try filling the container with the snake to win. 
 
Achievement: 
I'm proud of this project because it's my own project I developed which took me about a week on my own. I added a few animations with CSS that I didn't have. I've also added sounds to when ever a snake gets an apple and when the snake hits an object. I want to be a game developer and doing this just brought me closer to my dream job and I'm really thrilled how nice it came out even though it's simple. Throughout the years I will keep adding new things to make this game creative and fun as I learn more as a developer.
